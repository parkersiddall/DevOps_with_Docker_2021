After finishing the Full Stack Open MOOC earlier this year I created the following app using ExpressJS and React/Redux:

https://bookmarks-by-parker.herokuapp.com/

For exercise 2.11 I wrote Dockerfiles for the frontend and backend, then a docker-compose file in order to get them up and running. 

You can check out the work here:
